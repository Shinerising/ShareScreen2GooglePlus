Capture your screen and Share it to Google+ with Hotkey!

This application is still in Beta so there may be lots of bugs. I'll try to update it if needed;

You must enter your Gmail address, Google+ password and your Google+ ID(can be found in your Google+ profile url). This infomation will only be used to log in Google+ and post your statues, I promise it won't be upload to other website and all the information will be encrypted and saved in your computer.(I provided the source code so you can check how the user information was used)

You can capture your screen and upload it with the HOTKEY: CTRL + ALT + G.

If you only want to share part of your screen, try HOTKEY: CTRL + ALT + H. Then you can choose the part you need to share.

Please notice this application won't be shown in Windows Taskbar but in Tasktray.
